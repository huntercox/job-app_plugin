This project is a WordPress plugin that I built from scratch for a new freight/logistics company. Unfortunately, the company went under before the site was actually finished and launched.

This project is tied to my other repository job-app_theme, which supplies the front-end of them form... those are located in the directory "/inc/form/*" and the "page-apply.php" file.

Although the site itself is not production ready, I did spend a lot of time testing the form, which was the main purpose of the website. The majority of code that deals with the job form is located in this repository.
